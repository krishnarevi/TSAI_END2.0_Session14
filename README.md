# BERT and BART

> by Krishna N Revi 

## Assignment ‚ùî

1. TASK 1: Train BERT using the code mentioned [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zp2_Uka8oGDYsSe5ELk-xz6wIX8OIkB7/view?usp=sharing) on the Squad Dataset for 20% overall samples (1/5 Epochs). Show results on 5 samples. 

2. TASK 2: Reproductive [these](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/) results, and show output on 5 samples.
3. TASK 3: Reproduce the training explained in this [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/bart-for-paraphrasing-with-simple-transformers-7c9ea3dfdd8c). You can decide to pick fewer datasets. 
4. Proceed to Session 14 - Assignment Solutions page and:
   1. Submit README link for Task 1 (training log snippets and 5 sample results along with BERT description must be available) - 750
   2. Submit README link for Task 2 (training log snippets and 5 sample results) - 250
   3. Submit README link for Task 3 (training log snippets and 5 sample results along with BART description must be available) - 1000
